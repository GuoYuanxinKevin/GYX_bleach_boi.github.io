This is a freshman-level independent study course where various topics in linear algebra are included. 
The course basically follows 
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf"><i>Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares</i></a>.
In the course report and the presentation slides, some of the common approaches of solving linear least squares are reviewed and their time complexities are reviewed. A few applications are 
also included.

This independent study course covers multiple mathematical subjects that are highly relavant to data science. 
The reference book is  
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book%20no%20so;utions%20March%202019.pdf"><i>Foundations of Data Science</i></a>, 
where Chapter 2,3,4,5,6,8 are mainly discussed.
The slides and the manuscript are the materials I used when lecturing on Markov chains and random walks. 
Some MCMC methods, e.g. Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampler, are introduced. The mixing time of a random walk is also analyzed.

This project uses Monte Carlo method and neural networks to simulate the expected revenue for a inventory problem.
Performances of these two approaches are compared.
